         ------------------------------------- Answer -------------------------------------


          A) counter: Can be used as a name for a variable, attribute, or method,
              as it follows the naming conventions in Java.

          B) 1counter: Cannot be used as a name for a class, attribute, method, or variable,
              as it starts with a number, which is not allowed in Java.

          C) line counter: Cannot be used as a name for a class, attribute, method, or variable,
              as it contains white spaces. In Java, identifiers cannot contain spaces.

          D) Counter: Can be used as a name for a class, attribute, or method.
              It follows the naming convention of starting with an uppercase letter for class names in Java.

          E) count: Can be used as a name for a variable, attribute, or method,
              as it follows the naming conventions in Java.
